# Full Stack React App with a REST API

This application allows users to create an account and log in - once logged in, users are able to add courses, and are able to edit and delete courses that they had created.

## How to get started
### API
Once in the `/treehouse-unit-10` directory, run the following:

1. `cd api` to change to the `/api` directory
2. `npm run seed` to create the courses and users database, and seed it with initial data
3. `npm start` to launch the API to `http://localhost:5000/`

### Client
Return to the `/treehouse-unit-10` directory and run the following:

1. `cd client` to change to the `/client` directory
2. `npm start` to launch the React application to `http://localhost:3000`
